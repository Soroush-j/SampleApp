# SampleApp
This app was created as a playground and sample (hence the name!) for me to work on my skills, improve them and hopefully create new things.

Although Android Jetpack hasn't been used yet, it will be in the near future. I've used the following libraries throughout the app:
[Android Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/), 
[Android Live Data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), 
[Android Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation.html), 
[Android Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/), 
[Android Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), 
[Android View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), 
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger), 
[Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit), 
[RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), 
[Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)

The API that was used for the movies' information is from here: [Movies api](http://moviesapi.ir/) thanks to Abbas Oveissi.

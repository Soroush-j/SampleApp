# SampleApp
This app was created as a playground and sample (hence the name!) for me to work on my skills, improve them and hopefully create new things.

Although Android Jetpack hasn't been used yet, it will be in the near future. I've used the following libraries throughout the app:
[Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/), 
[Live Data](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), 
[Navigation](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/navigation.html), 
[Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/), 
[Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), 
[View Model](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), 
[Dagger 2](https://github.com/google/dagger), 
[Retrofit 2](https://github.com/square/retrofit), 
[RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava), 
[Picasso](https://github.com/square/picasso)
